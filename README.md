* fiberphotometry_processing.py and fiberphotometry_stats.ipynb process fiber photometry data for Figures 1C-D, written by Oliver Barnstedt.
* opto_treadmill_calculations.py and opto_treadmmill_functions.py process treadmill data for Figures 1F,G,J and S3C-F, written by Petra Mocellin.
* opto_treadmill_lfp.py and simpleLFP process treadmill LFP data for Figures 1I and S2A-B, written by Kevin Luxem and Petra Mocellin.
* opto_face_traces.Rmd and opto_face_stats.ipynb process facial optical flow data for Figure 2, written by Oliver Barnstedt.
* opto_openfield_calculations.py and opto_openfield_functions.py processes freely moving trajectory data for Figures 3A-B, 4B,C,E-J, 5B-D, S5A-C, S6A,C,D, written by Kevin Luxem and Petra Mocellin.
* opto_reward.ipynb processes treadmill data with a reward zone for Figure S4B-G, written by Oliver Barnstedt.
* opto_EPM.py processes elevated plus maze data for Figure 5G-J, written by Oliver Barnstedt and Petra Mocellin.
* invitro_ephys contains all code to process patch-clamp whole-cell data for Figure S9, written by Dennis Dal√ºgge.
* Figures 3C-D, S6B were generated using VAME (https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME), adjusted for this data by Kevin Luxem.
* Figures S5D,E,G were processed using code from https://github.com/CogEmLab/lfp_mocellin_etal, written by Sanja Mikulovic.
* Freely moving data were processed using DeepLabCut by Mathis et al. (2018): https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut
